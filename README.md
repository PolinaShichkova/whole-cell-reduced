# whole-cell-reduced
This project is about encoding the Whole Cell model, but in a simplified manner. See the Wiki for more information on the single submodules we created, and how we created them. 

This project started as a Whole Cell Workshop funded by the Volkswagen Stiftung. The workshop took place Oct 10-11, 2015. It was a satellite to the COMBINE 2015 meeting. 

For further questions, feel free to contact the project members :-)
