This page describes how to the metabolism submodules were generated.
* The code for model generation is available from https://github.com/dagwa/wholecell-metabolism

# Toy model
A toy model for the coupling of ODE/SSA with FBA simulations was generated using SBML and fbc v2 and comp v1.

# Full model
The annotated SBML was generated from the Matlab source code and the wholecell knowledgebase.
