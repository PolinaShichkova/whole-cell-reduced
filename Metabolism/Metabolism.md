# Metabolism
TODO:
This page describes how to build the transcription and rna decay submodules.
* Go to https://github.com/0u812/wc2_transcription
* There are 5 directories: model, model-builders, runners, spreadsheets, and tests
  * **spreadsheets** contains the reactions and species of each module and is used to generate files in subsequent steps
  * **model-builders** contains Python scripts to build Antimony and SBML files
  * **model** contains files generated by **model-builders**
  * **runners** contains SED-ML and Python scripts to run the generated models
  * **tests** contains model tests such as mass balance

# Toy model


# Full model
The annotated SBML was generated from the Matlab source code and the wholecell knowledgebase.

  * TODO
* Part 2:
  * TODO
For metabolism, Part 1 is handled by [build_model_transcription.py](https://github.com/0u812/wc2_transcription/blob/master/model-builders/build_model_transcription.py), whereas Part 2 is handled by [transcription_convert_to_sbml.py](https://github.com/0u812/wc2_transcription/blob/master/model-builders/transcription_convert_to_sbml.py). Generated files are put in the `models` subdirectory of the repository.
